To be published by **Springer** 

## Overview
The merging of computer systems and physical-mechanical systems led to the creation of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). A cyber-physical system combines software systems, sensors, and actuators connected over computer networks. Through these sensors, data about the physical world can be captured for processing. The software system processes the captured data from the sensors and makes decisions. The decisions are sent as signals to trigger the actuators to perform specific actions that affect the state of the physical world. Today examples of cyber-physical systems are everywhere, from autonomous vehicles to wearable devices.

The fact that CPS directly impacts the physical world made the security and trust of cyber-physical systems a significant concern. The complexity and the scale of CPS introduced various security, privacy and trust challenges that traditional security engineering practices cannot handle.

The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for cyber-physical systems hardening encompasses various techniques, methodologies and best practices to mitigate vulnerabilities and security risks in CPS by eliminating potential security threats and reducing the systems’ attack surface. The book focuses on the applications of artificial intelligence in hardening CPS against conventional and unconventional attack vectors. It covers diverse methods and techniques for hardening software, hardware, firmware, infrastructure, and communication channels in CPS.

## Objectives
This book aims to publish high-quality original research contributions on theory and applied aspects of engineering secure Cyber-Physical Systems by lever artificial intelligence. It seeks to strengthen the body of knowledge by providing insights into techniques for hardening software, hardware, firmware, infrastructure, and communication channels in CPS.

## Intended audience
This book will be helpful for senior undergraduate and graduate students interested in cyber-physical systems hardening in computer science and engineering.  Professionals  and researchers interested in cyber-physical systems and the application of AI in systems hardening will gain an in-depth overview of the current state-of-the-art.
